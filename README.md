# KillerDemo
`Refer to WebshellKiller and you will see it... `

I wrote these shit code just to make a POC of [**WebshellKiller**](https://github.com/fragileeye/WebshellKiller)

# Notice
The program runs on `Flask`, and may load slowly because the WebshellDetector should load completely before use.

# Pieces
Firstly, run this program, then you can see as follow:

and click the `OfflineDetect` button

Input a valid directory, click the button and see the result as follow:

The same way click the `RealtimeDetect` button

Copy some evil files(extension with php, jsp, aspx...) into monitored directory
