# KillerDemo
`Refer to WebshellKiller and you will see it... `

I wrote these shit code just to make a POC of [**WebshellKiller**](https://github.com/fragileeye/WebshellKiller)

# Notice
The program runs on `Flask`, and may load slowly because the WebshellDetector should load completely before use.

# guide

Firstly, run this program, then you can see as follow:

Then, we enter the frontpage

<br />
and click the `OfflineDetect` button
---
![Offline](https://github.com/fragileeye/KillerDemo/blob/master/images/3.jpg)
<br />
Input a valid directory, click the button and see the result as follow:

<br />
The same way click the `RealtimeDetect` button
---

<br />
Copy some evil files(extension with php, jsp, aspx...) into monitored directory

<br />
I believe everyone could use this...
